What began as an experiment in digital ownership has become the catalyst for a modern art movement and a dynamic subculture synonymous with the new age of internet.

A pioneering digital art project on the Ethereum blockchain, Crypto Punks launched on June 23, 2017 as a collection of 10,000 unique, 24x24 characters inspired by the London ‘80s punk scene and ‘90s cyberpunk culture.

The pixelated humans, apes, zombies, and aliens have since served as the rosetta stone for new generative collections time and time again, sold for millions at Christie’s and Sotheby’s auctions, and found homes in the permanent collections of major art institutions, including ICA Miami, Centre Pompidou, and LACMA.

Today, firmly rooted in an ethos of anonymity, decentralization, and community, Crypto Punks continues to be trailblazer for digital art and on-chain collectibles.

The project that inspired the modern Crypto Art movement.

Crypto Punks are one of the earliest and most iconic examples of "Non-Fungible Tokens” minted on Ethereum, and were the inspiration for the ERC-721 standard which powers most digital art and collectibles on-chain.

Since their release on June 23, 2017, Crypto Punks have been featured in numerous international publications, headlined prestigious international auctions at both Christie’s and Sotheby’s, and even entered the permanent collections of important art museums such as the ICA Miami, the Centre Pompidou, and the LACMA.

Marketplace Browse Punks Imagining “a small, weird, but cool experiment” in digital ownership on the blockchain, programmers John Watkinson and Matt Hall of Larva Labs initially set out to explore the dynamics of virtual scarcity and demand.

Using a set of algorithmic templates that ensured no two Punks were the same, they generated 10,000 distinct avatars and released 9,000 of them to the public as free-to-claim NFTs.

Crypto Punks’ model of on-chain art ownership was revolutionary, enabling direct, transparent transactions between collectors and artists.

It represents a milestone in the ever-evolving landscape of New Media art, a movement that emerged conceptually in the mid-1960s and was championed by the likes of Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Nam June Paik.

Demand from collectors and art institutions alike hit record highs, and it became clear that the “small” experiment was more than a collection of entries on a public ledger — it was the beginning of a new era for technology, art, and the connection between them.
