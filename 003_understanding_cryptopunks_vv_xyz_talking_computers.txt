Talking Computers If you're not familiar with code at all, there are a few basics we have to cover.

Software code is a set of statements that tell the thing running the code what to do...

There are many many different languages, but they all share some general characteristics.

For us, we're looking at "Solidity" code, which is the most common programming language used to develop Smart Contracts on Ethereum.

It compiles to low level machine code that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine ("EVM").

We can think of the EVM as a virtualized computer that makes sure EVM code runs exactly the same on all machines participating in the network.

Open the Crypto Punks Market.sol code for the Crypto Punks Market in a separate window to follow along!

There are two dedicated code-reader apps you can use right in your browser:Contract Reader Deth.

Net Alternatively you can download the code to your computer and open it in a text editor.

Section Overview1.

Functions Functions are the core building blocks of smart contracts.

Most importantly, they make up our entry points to stuff our users aught to be able to do...2.

Variables and Data Types In order to understand the Crypto Punks Marketplace we first have to get an undertanding of the different types of data points used.3.

Statements and Expressions Any complex algorithm is just many simple instructions, lined up.
